# crowdfunding-product-page

*Challange from Frontend Mentor*

Crowdfunding-product-page with 2 modals. The tricky part was dealing with the first modal, because it was scrollable and I couldn't use dialog html tag

I used here: 
* media queries
* a lot of eventListners
* checkbox
* css accent color
* svg (inside html) fill

summarizing it was easy, but time-consuming
