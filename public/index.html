                <p>
                    The Mastercraft Bamboo Monitor Riser is a sturdy and stylish
                    platform that elevates your screen to a more comfortable
                    viewing height. Placing your monitor at eye level has the
                    potential to improve your posture and make you more
                    comfortable while at work, helping you stay focused on the
                    task at hand. Featuring artisan craftsmanship, the
                    simplicity of design creates extra desk space below your
                    computer to allow notepads, pens, and USB sticks to be
                    stored under the stand.
                </p>
